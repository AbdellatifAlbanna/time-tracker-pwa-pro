Time Tracker PWA Pro (Personal)
==========================

How to run (fast):
1) Put this folder in iCloud Drive (optional).
2) Open index.html in a browser.
   - For best PWA behavior, serve locally:
     A) Install Node.js, then in this folder run:
        npx http-server -p 8080
     B) Open: http://localhost:8080

iPhone install:
- Open the site in Safari, tap Share → Add to Home Screen.

Sync with iCloud:
- Tap "Backup JSON" and save it in iCloud Drive.
- On the other device, tap "Restore JSON" and select the same backup file.

Notes:
- Notifications require permission and work best when the app is open/installed.
- One shift per work date (based on clock-in date).
